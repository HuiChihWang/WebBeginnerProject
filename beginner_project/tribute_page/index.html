      <div>Born in Philadelphia</div>
      <div>June 1996</div>
      <div>
        Selected 13th overall in the NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets out of
        Lower Merion High in Pennsylvania. Bryant was quickly traded to the Los
        Angeles Lakers in exchange for center Vlade Divac.
      </div>

      <div>
        In his rookie season, Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star
        Weekend, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to ever do so. In
        Game 5 of the second round of the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, he
        infamously shot four airballs as the Lakers were eliminated. He was
        named to the All-Rookie second team after his first campaign.
      </div>
      <div>1998</div>
      <div>
        Made first of his 18 All-Star appearances, which included 17 straight
        from 2000-16. The Lakers lost to the Jazz in the Western Conference
        Finals that season.
      </div>

      <div>
        Won his first of five NBA championships (2000-02, 2009-10). That season,
        he also made the first of his nine All-NBA Defensive first teams.
      </div>
      <div>2002</div>
      <div>
        Named to first of 11 All-NBA first teams, which is tied for the most in
        NBA history with Karl Malone and LeBron James.
      </div>
      <div>July 2003</div>
      <div>
        Arrested in Eagle, Colorado, as part of an investigation of a sexual
        assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. The charges
        were dropped 14 months later and after his accuser filed a civil suit,
        they reached a settlement.
      </div>
      <div>Jan. 22, 2006</div>
      <div>Won his lone NBA MVP award.</div>

      </div>
      <div>April 13, 2016</div>
      <div>
        In his final NBA game, Bryant put forth a vintage performance, scoring
        60 points against the Jazz in a 101-96 Lakers win, becoming the oldest
        player in NBA history to score 60 in a game. That is also the most
        points any NBA player has ever scored in his final game. He finished his
        career with 33,643 points, which was third in NBA history until James
        surpassed the mark on Jan. 25, 2020. He had played his final game in
        Salt Lake City a few weeks prior, where the Jazz played a tribute video
        to honor him.
