              Selected 13th overall in the NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets
              out of Lower Merion High in Pennsylvania. Bryant was quickly
              traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for center Vlade
              Divac.

              In his rookie season, Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest at NBA
              All-Star Weekend, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to
              ever do so. In Game 5 of the second round of the playoffs against
              the Utah Jazz, he infamously shot four airballs as the Lakers were
              eliminated. He was named to the All-Rookie second team after his
              first campaign.

              In his final NBA game, Bryant put forth a vintage performance,
              scoring 60 points against the Jazz in a 101-96 Lakers win,
              becoming the oldest player in NBA history to score 60 in a game.
              That is also the most points any NBA player has ever scored in his
              final game. He finished his career with 33,643 points, which was
              third in NBA history until James surpassed the mark on Jan. 25,
              2020. He had played his final game in Salt Lake City a few weeks
              prior, where the Jazz played a tribute video to honor him.
